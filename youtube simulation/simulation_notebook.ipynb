    "    * NOTE from 7/31: I'm still not sure what the issue is. It's not extremeness (I don't think), it's not the amount of views, and the issue is the same even when scaling up the number of videos. Thus, there's a chance it's something with how the videos are being generated, and whether a) every agent is seeing every video (which they probably aren't), or b) it's something with the agent's \"pickiness\" in terms of selecting a video\n",
    "    * NOTE from 8/1: okay what the HECK did I change. I changed something somewhere (I think it was the thresholds in the behavior_reference doc), but now for some reason just about every agent is watching a video. Literally what. I guess I won't complain because it's \"working\" now, but I have no clue if that was what fixed it. \n",

    "    * e.g. do more extreme agents get channeled to more extreme videos? what graph would show that?\n",
    "    * Does the recommendation system make users watch more extreme videos than what they would watch without the system? Can we compare side-by-side the video extremeness for agents with and without the system?\n",
    "    * If the recommendation system does, in fact, channel viewers towards more extreme content, in what ways can we mitigate or reduce these effects?\n",
    "    * Do extreme videos continually beget more extreme videos? i.e. is there a \"rabbit hole\" effect where an agent's watched videos become more and more extreme? Can we use a graph to make a map of which videos (and their extremeness) recommend each other?\n",

    "# The Recommendation Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, so. Paul Covington, Jay Adams, and Emre Sargin. 2016. Deep Neural Networks for YouTube Recommendations. In Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys '16). Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 191–198. https://doi.org/10.1145/2959100.2959190 is a paper from Google that outlines how their recommendation system works. Fantastic hearing it right from them. In short, they use two very large neural networks: one to narrow down the massive corpus of YouTube videos into a couple hundred that are relevant to the user, and one to rank these aforementioned videos in order of relevance to the user (which is then what's recommended). The narrowing down part isn't too exciting; there's a nice fancy equation they give for it. What I'm more concerned about is the ranking part. The videos are ranked by using logistic regression to assign a \"score\" to each video based on several hundred \"features\" about the user and video in question. This kind of bothers me. The paper lists some of these \"incredibly robust\" features (whether the user is logged in, their previous search queries, user's past history with the video's channel), but what are the rest of them??? I found another article (https://thecityvoice.org/2020/05/14/google-wants-to-know-your-gender-heres-why/) that discusses how Google's ad service determines your gender of its own accord and uses this determination in its marketing, which may have me predisposed to being suspicious of these supposedly robust features, but I only found that in the first place because the paper mentions that gender is considered as a factor (and on a [0,1] scale). So. I also didn't get any answer on how exactly videos relate to each other--I wasn't able to tell in how much isolation the neural network part happens from the actual video being watched, but it seems the video currently being watched only impacts which videos are narrowed down from the corpus (since it's in that equation).\n",
    "\n",
    "### How My Algorithm Has to Work\n",
    "\n",
    "After reading that paper this almost feels like working for the enemy. I guess I have to create a similar \"score-assigning\" ranking system, but what will my incredibly robust features be? In this case, it's probably extremeness, but is that enough? Enough for what--getting a larger holistic picture of the recommendation system, or how particularly the recommendation system uses extremeness? I should also look into logistic regression--I'm sure Scikit or some other library I already have imported here has some flavor of it that I can use."
